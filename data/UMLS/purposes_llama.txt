Based on the provided document segments, the key purposes and motivations for creating and extending the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) knowledge graph are:

1. **Fostering interoperability**: To enable the creation of more effective and interoperable biomedical information systems and services, including electronic health records.
2. **Integration of vocabularies**: To bring together various health and biomedical vocabularies and standards, harmonizing terminology and enabling interoperability between different computer systems.
3. **Improving entity and relation definitions**: To provide hierarchies, definitions, relationships, and other attributes for terms and codes from multiple vocabularies.
4. **Supporting clinical practice**: To link terms and codes across healthcare entities, facilitating communication and coordination among healthcare professionals.
5. **Enhancing patient care coordination**: To facilitate communication among hospital departments and improve patient care.
6. **Advancing text processing**: To extract concepts, relationships, or knowledge from medical texts and improve natural language processing.
7. **Terminology mapping**: To map between different terminologies and facilitate the exchange of information between systems.
8. **Local terminology development**: To create and maintain local terminologies, allowing for customization and adaptation to specific contexts.
9. **Supporting research**: To investigate terminologies or ontologies, enabling researchers to better understand and analyze biomedical data.

These purposes and motivations highlight the importance of creating and extending the UMLS knowledge graph to improve the integration, sharing, and reuse of biomedical information, ultimately enhancing healthcare
